This is a repository of good liturgical music, made available for anybody who wants it. It is very much incomplete, but it will improve over time.

I made this site for a number of reasons:

- There is unfortunately less good music being produced in today's Missouri Synod congregations than there should be. The reasons for this are legion, but they're not malicious: rather, they're systematic. Music directors so often just don't know where to find good music. Over the years, I've learned how to find good music from the Lutheran tradition, and how to make it workable for my choir and congregation. These scores are exactly that: good Lutheran music sourced from all over, put into an accessible form, made available for anybody who wants them.

- Lots of people have asked for these scores, and it took me a long time to figure out how to make that possible in a way that served both the people who were asking for the scores as well as the person making the scores (me). I think I've finally figured it out, though I'm still constructing the workflow—that this site is live is proof of the concept.

- I like nerdery. This site is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html), and HTML, incorporates [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is version-controlled by [Git](https://git-scm.com/). The file archive and database are populated by [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts. The workflow still needs improvement: in the future [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) will move the files around and trigger the scripts automatically—but one thing at a time.
