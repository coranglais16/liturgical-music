This is a repository of good liturgical music, made available for anybody who wants it.

I made this site for a number of reasons:

- There is unfortunately less good music being produced in today's Missouri Synod congregations than there should be. The reasons for this are legion, but they're not malicious: rather, they're systematic. Music directors so often just don't know where to find good music. Over the years, I've learned how to find good music from the Lutheran tradition, and how to make it workable for my choir and congregation. These scores are exactly that: good Lutheran music sourced from all over, put into an accessible form, made available for anybody who wants it.

- People all over have asked for these scores, and it took me a long time to figure out how to make that possible in a way that served both the people who were asking for the scores as well as me, creating the scores.

- I like nerdery. This site is written in Markdown and HTML, incorporating Bootstrap, is built with Jekyll, is served on GitHub Pages, and is version-controlled by Git.
