This is a repository of good liturgical music, made available for anybody who wants it.

I made this site for a number of reasons:

- There is a dearth of good music being produced in today's Missouri Synod congregations. The reasons for this are legion. But they are not malicious: they're systematic. Music directors so often just don't know what good music is or where to find it. Their taste is off. Over my time in the industry, I've learned how to find good music from the Lutheran tradition, and how to make it workable for my choir and congregation.

- People all over have asked for these scores, and it took me a long time to figure out how to make that possible in a way that served both the people who were asking for the scores as well as me, creating the scores.

- I like nerdery. This site is written in Markdown and HTML, incorporating Bootstrap, is built with Jekyll, is served on GitHub Pages, and is version-controlled by Git.
