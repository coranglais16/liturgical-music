## About This Site
This is a repository of good liturgical music, made available for anybody who wants it. It is very much incomplete, but it will improve over time.

I made this site for a number of reasons:

- There is unfortunately less good music being produced in today's Missouri Synod congregations than there should be. The reasons for this are legion, but they're not malicious: rather, they're systematic. Music directors so often just don't know where to find good music. Over the years, I've learned how to find good music from the Lutheran tradition, and how to make it workable for my choir and congregation. These scores are exactly that: good Lutheran liturgical music sourced from all over, put into an accessible form, made available for anybody who wants them.

- Lots of people have asked for these scores, and it took me a long time to figure out how to make that possible in a way that served both the people who were asking for the scores as well as the person making the scores (me). I have always been happy to share scores, but since I produce so many of them, it has been difficult to remember what has been shared with whom. Putting scores on CPDL is one solution, but given the rather personalized nature of these scores (incorporating specific hymn/Psalm verses, or specific English translations keyed to the LCMS hymnals), they are less useful to the general musical/academic community, and so CPDL would not be a great fit for them. What I needed was a system that would automatically populate an independent online repository of files and an associated database every time I produced a new score. That way I would not have to send out email attachments or keep track of who asked for what piece. I think I've finally figured it out, though I'm still constructing the workflow—that this site is live is proof of the concept.

- I like nerdery, and this project is an outlet for it. This site is written in [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), [LiquidJS](https://liquidjs.com/tutorials/intro-to-liquid.html), [YAML](https://yaml.org/), and HTML, incorporates [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), is served on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), and is version-controlled by [Git](https://git-scm.com/). The file archive and database are populated by [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) scripts. The knowledge of these technologies and how to make them work together is thanks to [Programming By Stealth](https://pbs.bartificer.net). The workflow still needs improvement: in the future [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/) will move the files around and trigger the scripts automatically—but one thing at a time.
